        The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian
         pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu.
          Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of
           around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the
            Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one
             to remain largely intact.<br><br>
             The pyramids were designed as tombs. The Great Pyramid, 
             therefore, contains three burial chambers that were 
             intended to house Khufu and a supplication of goods
              and treasures that he was to take with him in the 
              afterlife. 
             When entering the pyramid, there is a passage that descends
              about 354 feet (ca. 108 m) into the bedrock, then levels
               off. It continues another 29 feet (ca. 9 meters) to an
                unfinished, underground chamber. <br>
             
             After which there is a hole in the roof that leads to
              the ascending passage, a 129-foot stretch rising to 
              the Grand Gallery, this is the only known pyramid with a
               passage that slopes upward. <br>
             
             At the entrance of the Gallery is a passage to the Queens 
             Chamber.<br>
             
             There is a series of shafts, stretching from the north 
             and south walls.<br><br>
             Historians believe that the Giza pyramids were 
             constructed using more than two million stones 
             ranging from 2 tons to 50 tons.<br><br>
             Construction on the Pyramids of Giza started in
              2580 BC. A lot of time and effort was required to 
              build these pyramids, each one averaging about 
              two centuries. 

About 138 pyramids were built in ancient Egypt and the amount 
spent on their construction is not only the phenomenal thing 
but also the amount of thought that went into their positioning 
in relation to the stars.<br><br>
